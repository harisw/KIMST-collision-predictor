First page
- The TMO Rules Window needs to show rule tag like R1, R2
- Can't understand what the rules stand for(need a pop up window showing relationship between rules like R1 - R2- R3, R4) I think just putting related rules together is enough
  like R1 - R2 - R5,    R2 - R3 -R6,    R3- R5 - R7 something like this
- TMO scenario window needs explanation of RMSO RHSO(maybe just write full name)
- About the CQ rules need a new pop up window to show CQ on a map(draw CQ on map and tag them with R1, R#)

Second page
- on the input rules window, only show the rules that are on the map (when displaying rules display them like 
R1 if A then B
+ if B then C(forward rules)
- R2 if Z then A, R3 -------- (backward rules)
but to be honest i think we can keep it like
- R1--------------
   FB - R1----------
   BB - R2 -----------
           R3 -----------
but show all at first and when the negative sign is clicked it hides FB BB and just shows R1
- put tag on CQ map(R1, R2 on CQs)
- prof suggested two ways, 
   first on the object window just show current objects like 
   obj1 at (x,y) 
   obj 2 at(x,y) 
   and detected objects window show rule number, detected obj, current time, location and he watns format like R1 {Obj1,Obj3} current time {location}
  second way is simulation shows object's pattern path. object location window shows like obj1 : pattern type, time, location
obj2 : pattern type, time, location
and the detected object window shows detected Objects like
obj2 : detected time, location
obj3 : detected time, location
I think he wants both ways to be implemented and (user can switch two ways)-> let's just make it they can choose at first page

fourth page
V decrease the size of sonar cus sonar and radar can't be the same size

fifth page
V increase the size of sonar sensor cus can't see them
